# so_long
Game made for 42 school project using MiniLBX library and C.

It consists on a game where you have to leave the spaceship without touching the aliens, you need to compile it and then run in with a map with ./so_long map.ber

The game is divided in 3 parts:

1: Reading the map and checking if it is a valid map, for that you have to use some algorithm that will read each file of the file and take it into an array.

2: Taking every char of the file you created and printing in to the screen using the MiniLBX library.

3: Taking the inputs of the keyboyd and mouse, and moving your chacaracter until you leave the spaceship safely, the game must have no leaks at all.
